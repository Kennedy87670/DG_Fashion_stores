## Introduction
My current training at Utiva included a Capstone Project focused on the BG Group premium fashion lines. This project allowed me to practice my data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills using power bi. Additionally, I created a reporting dashboard to showcase my findings from the dataset. Overall, the project was an excellent opportunity to apply what I learned in the training and gain hands-on experience with real-world data.


## Problem statement 
-	What is the top sales by City?
- What is the top 10 agents per sales value?
- Sales territory?
- Sales by validation?
- Sales chain category?
- Top 5 IDs per sale value?

 Create a dashboard with the report and sliceable by:
- 	Territory
-

It has 3 tables;
Names (9 columns   105 rows)
Shop Territory (3 columns 105 rows)
Competitive Territory (2 columns and 11 rows)
